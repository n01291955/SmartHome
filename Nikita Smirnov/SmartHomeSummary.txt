Project Description/Executive Summary:

SmartHome - is a project consisting of a physical device and an app. 
SmartHomeâ€™s task is to allow the user to use the physical device as security and monitoring system while being able to control it in the app. 
The app shows information about/from 3 sensors: motion, sound, temperature & humidity. 
The main feature is that turning security mode ON (in the app) causes a buzzer/alarm to go off and a notification to get issued if either motion or sound sensors have been triggered.
